I go by **Ishaan Gupta**, and it's a pleasure to _meet_ you.
Thank you for taking such genuine interest in getting to know me. 
Because I am really not that interesting you see. I am ***just your average Bioinformatics ~~Reseaecher~~ student***
- [x] working in a CRISPR gene editing lab that is working on making multi-dose Gene therapy by computationally finding immune orthologonal epitopes to replace in the main proteins used - Cas9 enzyme and AAV vector - so as to circumvent immune surveilance due to weaker MHC-I binding and hence decreased antigen presentation to the T-cells, and then experimentally confirming by building Cas9 combinatorial libraries, Nanopore sequncing them, and then analyzing the long reads to find which combinations of mutations are the most effective at evading immune response
- [ ] trying to get better at Deep Learning through
  1. Online courses (duh!)
  2. Trying some Kaggle challenges ( DUH!)
     - [x] Training a GAN to produce fake tumor images for image data augmentation, resolving the issue of data scarcity and class imbalance in tumor images datasets. (Yes, you can [check it out](https://www.kaggle.com/ishaanash/gan-ddsm-augmentation) )
  3. [ ] In the future working on molecular sequence analysis based projects like error correction of reads and predicting the role of genomic region using CNNs or LSTMs
- [ ] finally starting to answer why you (yes, you) respond differently to a drug, virus, pathogen, vaccine, or [your own immune cells](https://www.google.com/search?q=autoimmunity&oq=autoimmunity&aqs=chrome..69i57.3139j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) than me, or more precisely, what makes an immune system more successful, a big question that necessitates **Personalized Immunogenomics**, and involves open challenges like annotating the VDJ region of our genome and also experimental immunology approaches.
- [x] and helping spawn other Bioinformatics ~~Reseaecher~~ students like me, by making and delivering bootcamp lessons on Bash, Python, NumPy and Pandas, Machine Learning, Alignment, Phylogeny, Dynamic Programming etc. at [UBIC](https://ubicucsd.github.io/) so that people can start making notebooks starting with
    ```python
    #imports
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import scipy.stats as ss
    from scipy.stats import norm
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    import statsmodels.api as sm
    from Bio import pairwise2
    from Bio.Seq import Seq
    
    !wget --no-check-certificate 'https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1qalp5p_feGsd-G_FtOq6v-OAb5US3rDM' -O unidentified.fasta
    record = SeqIO.read("unidentified.fasta", "fasta") 
    ```
If you liked knowing and want to read again, [go back to the top](#hi)

Well, Python's just cool. It provides amazing scientific computing and plotting packages, and is just perfect data analysis, while also allowing scripting, so it's more easily transferable into C++ for building faster software. Python has highly useful deep learning and Bioinformatics frameworks, so it is definitely my main tool.
